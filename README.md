Data Structures and Algorithms will focus on understanding key concepts related to data structures and the analysis of algorithms. Data structures is a key computer science discipline that focuses on understanding how to efficiently and effectively organize data. Specifically, this course will present a number of advanced conceptual topics related to software maintainability, efficiency, and algorithm analysis. The topics presented in this course will range from introducing abstract data types (ADTs) such as bags, stacks, queues, deques, and priority queues, to further analyzing the efficiency associated with the ADTS and other algorithms.
